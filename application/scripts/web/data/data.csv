My first monograph, Ordering Anarchy: Armies and Leaders in Tacitus' Histories (London and Ann Arbor, Michigan 1999) explored the creative and subtle ways in which Tacitus characterises the four armies who participated in the explosive civil wars of AD68-69, as well as considering his representation of the four emperors, Galba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasian. This is a period uniquely rich in parallel sources: comparison with the biographies of Plutarch and Suetonius, and with the epitomised historical narrative of Cassius Dio, enables us to see how Tacitus handles the historical tradition about a complex period and confronts in a balanced way biased sources who tended to favour the victor in the civil war, Vespasian.|||In addition, I am interested in the ways in which the distinctive syntax and vocabulary of Tacitus' Latin contributes to his historical interpretation of events. I have been able to pursue this and other questions of interpretation in a detailed way through my commentaries on Tacitus Histories II (Cambridge 2007) and Tacitus Annals 15 (Cambridge 2018). I think that it is crucial that Classics should be an accessible subject. To that end I co-authored a general handbook with Dr Alison Sharrock (Manchester University), Fifty Key Classical Authors (Routledge 2002) and I also published a book for children, Mystery History of the Roman Colosseum (Aladdin 1997). My other areas of interest include ancient epistles, Greek and Roman biography, battle narratives, Cicero, Sallust, Livy, Pliny the Elder, and Pliny the Younger, on which I have written various articles over the years. My next project will be a monograph offering close readings of passages from Pliny the Elder Natural History book nine (on fish) as a launchpad to explore more widely various intriguing aspects of social and cultural history under the Roman empire. Some preliminary thinking about  one aspect of this project formed the focal point of my keynote lecture ('Tiberius in Space: Proxemics and the Portrayal of the Princeps') which I delivered at the University of Queensland (July 2017) where I was honoured to be invited to visit as the R.D.

An analysis of the distribution of the names derived from the Hittite-Luwian divinity Arma in the Greek inscriptions of southern Anatolia then establishes the origin of the dedicant. The way in which, in Lycia, the Arma theophoric names came to meet, adapt and survive in an onomastic landscape that became predominantly Greek in the course of the Hellenistic period, is explored by looking at the influence between these names and Greek personal names derived from Hermes. This onomastic enquiry results in a more accurate definition of the features and borders of onomastic units in Lycia and her immediate neighbours, and helps to recover elements of the centuries-long history of the populations of these regions.|||M.

But it is in Book 4 of the Republic that the most important ethical values of the ideal city, and the souls that embody them, are depicted in thought-provoking musical terms: in fact, moderation (sōphrosýnē) and justice (dikaiosýnē) are repeatedly described as a symphonic agreement of sounds (συμφωνία, Resp. 4.430e, 4.431e–432b) or even an actual ‘tuning system’ (ἁρμονία, Resp. 4.443c–444a).|||This paper will focus on Plato’s fascinating depiction of justice as special kind of harmonía that epitomises the best possible organisation of the soul, exploring his nuanced use of the model of lyre tunings in performative, theoretical as well as educational terms. More specifically, by comparing Plato’s use of harmonic imagery with technical discussions of lyre tunings and their key role in educational settings, I will show how Plato exploited distinctive features of traditional Greek lyre harmoníai to give shape to his innovative understanding of the structure of the soul and the harmonious, but not strifeless, relationship between its individual components. In the second part of this paper, I will look at how the model outlined in the Republic sheds light on the musical structure that gives shape to the World Soul in the Timaeus, advancing a new interpretation of its elusive harmonic organisation.|||More generally, this chapter aims at showing how Plato’s harmonic characterisation of the structure of the soul is essentially based on his (and his readers’) acquaintance with basic practical as well as theoretical features of these musical models. Hence, musical theory and practice represented a shared repertoire of concepts that Plato could embrace to express his innovative philosophical notions in terms that his readers could easily relate to on the basis of their own aesthetic, emotional, as well as cognitive experience.|||‘Tuning The Lyre, Tuning The Soul’: Harmonía And The Kósmos Of The Soul Between Plato’s Republic And Timaeus|||Conference paper|||Without Timotheus, much of our melopoiia would not exist; but without Phrynis, there wouldn’t have been Timotheus”: Pherecrates’ twelve strings, the strobilos and the harmonic paranomia of the New Music|||2018 | Journal article | Greek and Roman Musical Studies|||The seductive voice of the aulos in Plato’s Symposium: from the dismissal of the auletris to Alcibiades’ praise of Socrates-auletes|||2018 | Chapter | Music Cultures in Sounds, Words and Images|||in the symposium, Plato presents his readers with many different charac- terisations of the aulos and the performers of this instrument. at the very beginning of the drinking-party (symp. 176e7) the aulos-girl is sent away: given that this instru- ment played a very significant role in the sympotic practices of Classical athens, this exceptional choice calls for an explanation. in the light of the following develop- ments of the dialogue, the dismissal of the αὐλητρίς becomes even more significant. in fact, on the one hand, this character reappears at a key moment of the dialogue, as alcibiades’ dramatic appearance on scene is announced and accompanied precisely by the sound of her “voice” (αὐλητρίδος φωνὴν ἀκούειν, 212c8; cf. 212d6). On the other hand, in his following discourse of praise, alcibiades characterises Socrates as ‘the most wonderful αὐλητής’ and claims that this image not only epitomises the effect of Socrates’ words on the souls of his listeners (cf. 215b-216d) but reveals no less than “the truth” about Socrates (τοῦ ἀληθοῦς ἕνεκα, 215a9). but what do Socrates’ words have in common with the seductive voice of the aulos? in this paper, i will show how these apparently conflicting images can help us understand Plato’s complex and nu- anced attitude towards the alluring voice of the aulos and its psychological effects. more specifically, i will contend that alcibiades’ characterisation of Socrates as the ‘most wonderful aulete’ reveals how the power of Socrates’ seductive words can be truly likened to a ‘good use’ of auletic music. Just as marsyas’ and Olympus’ divine music is capable of revealing who needs to participate in mystic rites, so also Socrates’ aulemata are capable of achieving an effect that goes much deeper than mere rational persuasion and exposes the true ethical needs of his interlocutors. differently from what is often maintained, then, i will argue that Plato is not at all concerned with the capacity of the aulos to provoke deep and powerful emotions; on the contrary, far from rejecting entirely the intense and even ecstatic effects of music, Plato’s aim is to highlight the importance of using these powerful forces correctly. if oriented correctly, both musical and rhetorical aulemata become crucial educational “tools” to give shape to the soul and its inner hierarchy of desires. if oriented in the wrong ethi- cal direction, both the power of persuasive speech and that of music lead to the exact opposite result: psychological (and therefore political) strife.|||Reconstructing Damon: Music, Wisdom Teaching and Politics in Perikles’ Athens , written by Wallace, R.

The publication of my doctoral thesis, The Baths of Caracalla in Rome: a study in the design, construction and economics of large-scale building projects in imperial Rome, JRA, Suppl. 25 (Portsmouth R.I. 1997), won the Archaeological Institute of America’s James R. Wiseman Award for the most important work in archaeology for 1998, and has been fundamental in the development of the archaeology of construction as a new discipline within the field of classical archaeology, and I continue to be active in this area of research.

I then went on to do the Masters in Greek and Roman History at Balliol (2008-2010), where I wrote a thesis on the role of geography in Quintus Curtius Rufus' Historiae Alexandri Magni. During the MPhil, I also got the opportunity to explore the social and economic history of the Hellenistic world and to learn the disciplines of epigraphy and papyrology. For my DPhil in Ancient History at New College (2010-2013) I became interested in how to write history with geography, and ultimately I wrote a thesis about processes of regional integration on Lesbos and in the Troad. After finishing my doctorate, I was a Junior Research Fellow in Classics at The Queen's College (2013-2016), during which time I developed an interest in what the evidence of coins can tell us about regional dynamics.|||My research interests currently fall into three categories. Firstly, I am in the final stages of revising my PhD thesis for publication. This was a regional history of Lesbos and the the Troad from the 5th c. BC – 1st c. AD which explored the political, cultural, and social history of regional integration. Secondly, a related project which has come out of my PhD research involves reconstructing the monetary history of this region through a study of all the coinage produced at mints in this area from the 6th – 1st c. BC. Finally, the next big project which I have begun to work on is a social and cultural history of literary production in the Greek city-states of the Hellenistic period.|||Greek history 800 BC - AD 300, historical geography, literature and politics in the post-classical polis, Greek numismatics, Greek epigraphy.|||Selected Publications|||Memnon and Mentor of Rhodes in the Troad|||2018 | Journal article | Numismatic Chronicle|||This article presents a small hoard group from the Troad which appeared on the London market in February 2016. The hoard group can be dated to the mid-350s when Memnon and Mentor of Rhodes were ruling the Troad on behalf of the Persian authorities. It therefore provides a much-needed fixed point in the chronology of Troad coinages which allows us to re-date a number of other 4th century silver coinages from the Troad to the 350s/340s, thus producing a new picture of the region’s minting activity in this period. The hoard group contains one example of a rare anepigraphic series depicting an archaic cult statue of Athena Ilias on the reverse. This and other numismatic depictions of this cult statue can now be placed in the context of Memnon and Mentor’s rule of the Troad and provide an important precedent for the Hellenistic and Imperial-era koinon of Athena Ilias as an expression of regional identity.|||Preliminary Observations on the Archaic Silver Coinage of Lampsakos in its Regional Context|||2018 | Conference paper|||The Coinage and History of Achaiion in the Troad|||2017 | Journal article | Revue des Études Anciennes|||The Koinon of Athena Ilias and its Coiange|||2017 | Journal article | American Journal of Numismatics|||Mytilene, Lampsakos, Chios and the Financing of the Spartan Fleet (406-404)|||2016 | Journal article | Numismatic Chronicle|||More"

I have published a monograph on the literary representations of contemporary Greece in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Placing Modern Greece, Oxford, 2008).

Most recently I have enjoyed tutoring undergraduates in Classics, Ancient & Modern History, and Classical Archaeology and Ancient History at a number of colleges in Oxford, and joined Trinity in October 2015.|||My research interests are two-fold. My doctoral thesis (‘Obeloi and Iron in Archaic Greece’) addressed changes in the perception of iron during the period ca. 1100-500 B.C. and questions the orthodox model for the transition from bronze to iron in the eastern Mediterranean. My interest in iron has continued and as an invited specialist I am preparing for publication the finds of iron billets from the Kyrenia shipwreck of the early third century BC. These billets give an important rare glimpse into how iron was produced and traded during this period.|||My other research interest is the emergence of alphabetic Greek writing. As part of my work at the Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents I used the Anne Jeffery Archive as the core of a web-based research tool for the study of archaic Greek inscriptions (Poinikastas). Research in progress includes the study of “retrograde” letters in archaic Greek inscriptions combined with work on letter frequency as a comment on the degree of design in the Greek alphabet, and the probability with which it was the result of broad, informal experimentation in writing across the Greek world and beyond, rather than the work of a single inventor or product of a single source.|||Archaic Greek history and archaeology; Epigraphy; The emergence of alphabetic Greek writing; The development of iron during the Archaic and Classical periods.|||""Mods & Prelims (Classics / CAAH / AMH): Thucydides and the Greek West, Aristophanes’ Political Comedy, Texts & Contexts (Greek), Aristocracy & Democracy (""""Greek Core""""), Greek History 650-479 BC, The World of Homer & Hesiod, Foreign Texts: Herodotus 5.26-6.131, Greek language.|||FHS (Lit.

In 1984 I became Fellow and Tutor in Classics at Exeter College, Oxford, and in 1998 Professor of Greek and Latin Languages and Literature. In 2015, I was appointed to the Regius Chair of Greek, and so returned to Christ Church, having really seen the world.|||In my research work I seek, unusually for a classicist, to give equal attention to Greek and to Latin, and to work on both prose and poetry. Some of my books attempt to expand the literary understanding of periods or types of work which at the time had been relatively under-explored or under-valued. Others present sustained comment and analysis of particular texts. But I am generally concerned to combine detailed textual criticism and verbal interpretation with larger literary argument. In my opinion, these aspects of the subject should be in constant communication with each other, not frostily separated. I am interested too in the relation of literature to history, archaeology, philosophy, linguistics, and other areas.

I then returned to Greece and worked as full time archaeologist employed by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture in Thessaly, a position which allowed me to gain a deep understanding of Thessaly as a region. I was also invited to work as Research Associate in the Copenhagen Associations Project, responsible for the Thessalian evidence, and was awarded a three-months fellowship in the ERC Research program on Emotions at Oxford. My most recent work was for the Ephorate of Antiquities of Hemathia (Hellenic Ministry of Culture) in Macedonia, researching and writing entries for the virtual museum ‘Alexander the Great: from Aigai to the oecumene’. My current project as a Marie Curie Fellow aims to place my interdisciplinary approach of Thessalian cults and sacred space within the larger context of Hellenistic Religion and related socio-cultural attitudes and expectations.|||My current research titled 'Thessaly under the Kings: Religion, Society and the Politics of Multiculturalism in Mainland Greece’ examines the reorganization of sacred space, the cult practices and the religious beliefs in Thessaly from the mid-fourth to the second century BC. The evidence will be discussed in terms of continuity and change, from the gradual modification of the Thessalian geopolitical and urban landscapes exercised by the Macedonian rulers to the annexation of the region into the Hellenistic Kingdom of Macedonia, and down, finally, to the decline of the Macedonian power and the emergence of Roman control in the region. The project aims to examine the politics of the Hellenistic Kings and their influence over the reorganisation of local religious attitudes, with regards to the newly developed socio-cultural environment, with its multi-ethnic and multicultural communities and their competing claims that grew besides the official royal politics. Two key methodological approaches will be employed, a bottom-up interdisciplinary approach which will contextualise local religious attitudes and their political and socio-cultural agents through the study of archaeological, epigraphic, numismatic and literary sources, and a comparative approach that will relate the Thessalian evidence to other well-studied geographical regions of the Hellenistic World.|||Hellenistic Religion through archaeological, epigraphical and literary evidence, Thessalian cults, politics and sacred space, social and cultural anthropology of Ancient Greece, multiculturalism, identity politics, acculturation processes.|||Full Publications: dr_sofia_kravaritou-publications.docx|||Selected Publication:|||Cults and rites of passage in Ancient Thessaly|||Conference paper | Proceedings of the international conference Βορειοελλαδικά held in International conference in honour of Miltiades B. Hatzopoulos|||The aim of the paper is to reanimate the discussion on Thessalian rites of passage, in the light of supplementary epigraphic evidence, directly or indirectly related to local age-classes and pertinent ritualized attitudes. Focusing on age-classes is conditioned by the fact that their existence in a given society is a prerequisite for the performance of age-changing rites of passage. Archaeological evidence will be taken into consideration as well, in particular groups of votives from Thessalian sanctuaries dedicated to kourotrophic deities, who presided over the passage between the various stages of the human biological and social life. Lastly, attention will be paid to legendary narrations, which recount attitudes as well as feats of young Thessalian heroic figures.|||From Alkestis to Archidike: Thessalian Attitudes to Death and the Afterlife|||2018 | Chapter | Round Trip to Hades in the Eastern Mediterranean Tradition. Visits to the Underworld from Antiquity to Byzantium|||The aim of the chapter is to offer a regional perspective on the issue of Underworld journeys in Antiquity by tracing Thessalian attitudes to Hades from the Classical to the Hellenistic period. What do we know of the beliefs regarding the Underworld in Thessaly, a land where one of the most famous and successful katabaseis occurred? Our starting point will be the most famous Thessalian ‘round trip’ to Hades, that of Alkestis, portrayed through Athenian eyes in Euripides’ tragedy and Plato. This will allow us to discuss eschatological beliefs reflected in fifth-century bce Athenian literary works and address some of the stereotypes about Thessaly, as both are linked to the questions under discussion. We will then turn to Thessaly itself and exam- ine a variety of relevant evidence pertaining to cults of deities linked with passages and human destiny, the gold lamellae from Pherai and Pharsalos, funerary epigrams from the region echoing themes attested in the lamellae or revealing a concern with or a belief in the possibility of a blessed afterlife or for a ‘round trip to the Underworld’ and last but not least, the evidence from contemporary Thessalian necropoleis. As will be seen, the Thessalian evidence, although of a complex and often disparate nature, is suggestive of a heightened interest in the safe journey to the Underworld or a blessed afterlife.|||Thessaly, Greek Religion, funerary customs|||Ενεπίγραφες επιτύμβιες στήλες από το Κάστρο – Παλαιά του Βόλου|||2018 | Journal article | Tekmēria|||Four new inscribed funerary stelai of the Hellenistic and Roman Imperial periods are published in this article, found re-employed in the forti cation walls of the site ‘Kastro – Palaia’ in Volos.

The inscriptions are of simple formulas and the relief scenes present no grand artistic merits, nonetheless, the mon- uments have been accorded detailed discussion, as they bear upon a number of questions, which have either not yet been discussed in a systematic way or call for further investigation: the question of the original provenance of the tombstones in connection with the question of the identi cation of the set- tlement at ‘Kastro – Palaia’ and its relations to the neighbouring Macedonian royal foundation of Demetrias and its prosopography; the Attic and atticizing tradition and trend of the funerary monuments of the area; the relief scenes of the reclining banqueters, their character and relation to the painted scenes with the same subject from Demetrias; the question of the heroization of the ‘common dead’; and, last, the re-appropriation of the theme in the Roman Im- perial period.|||More"

Currently, I am completing a monograph, Inscribing Faith in Late Antiquity: Between Reading and Seeing (Routledge, forthcoming), that will be the first in-depth examination of the visual functions of texts inscribed within Christian, Jewish, and early Islamic buildings across the Mediterranean. Additional projects include two edited volumes, the first on late antique art and local identities, and the second on traveling Egyptian artists in late antiquity.

Combining methodologies from art history and social history as well as archaeology, this project will result in the first English-language monograph on the mosaics, and will sharpen our understanding of the evolving cultural and religious identities of Syrians in late antiquity.|||Late Antique art and archaeology; mosaics; Late Antique East|||Monumental Art of the Christian and Early Islamic East: Cultural Identities and Classical Heritage|||Manar al-Athar Photo Archive|||Full Publications: Dr Sean Leatherbury publications|||Selected Publications:|||Writing in Colour in Late Antiquity: Evidence from North African Mosaic Pavements|||Journal article | Mosaic|||Christian Wall Mosaics and the Creation of Sacred Space|||2018 | Chapter | The Routledge Handbook of Early Christian Art|||CHRISTIAN WALL MOSAICS AND THE CREATION OF SACRED SPACE Sean V|||.

A joint geoarchaeological research programme developed by CNRS, together with the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece, the British School at Athens, the Harokopiou University of Athens and the local archaeological services (Ephorate of Antiquities of Euboea), has endeavored to reconstruct the Holocene coastal landscape evolution in the vicinity of major archaeological sites along the southwest shoreline of Euboea Island (Greece), together with the history of human occupation. The sites of Lefkandi, Eretria, Amarynthos and the Lilas delta were selected for their rich archaeological record. During the work, 26 boreholes were drilled in the corresponding coastal plains. Laboratory analysis comprised the identification of mollusks and ostracods, together with granulometric analyses of the sediments, to characterize the different sedimentary environments. 71 radiocarbon dates provided a robust chronostratigraphic framework for the studied sites. In addition, a pollen sequence from Amarynthos was studied to reconstruct the vegetation history from ca. 5.500-4.300 (Neolithic times) and from 1.100-850 cal. BC (Early Iron Age). The results enable us to: (i) Reconstruct the Holocene shoreline migrations from the Lilas delta, in the north, to Amarynthos in the south. Three major phases of shoreline progradation are recorded at the end of the IVth/beginning of the IIIrd Millennium BC, at the beginning of the Ist Millennium BC and during the Ottoman period (XVth-XIXth Cent. AD), while a marine incursion occurred only in Eretria during the IInd millennium BC; ii) reconstruct the sea level curve for the last 8 millennia in the West-Central Aegean Sea. A significant role of local tectonic vertical movements (uplift) is evident, attested by the presence of several hiatuses in sedimentation; (iii) reconstruct for the first time the vegetation history in the surroundings of Amarynthos, from Neolithic times and Early Iron Age, within the broader South Aegean-Attica environmental context, which has never been achieved before. Human activities (grazing and cereal cultivation) are recorded since at least Late Neolithic times where an open landscape dominated until at least the Early Iron Age.|||Constructing Social Identities in Early Iron Age and Archaic Greece|||2017 | Book|||Offerings to the Goddess|||2017 | Chapter | ΤΕΡΨΙΣ : Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology in honour of Nota Kourou|||A Companion to the Archaeology of Early Greece and the Mediterranean|||2016 | Book|||THE MISSING DEAD: LATE GEOMETRIC BURIALS AT LEFKANDI|||2015 | Journal article | MEDITERRANEAN ARCHAEOLOGY Australian and New Zealand Journal for the Archaeology of the Mediterranean World|||More"

But it is in Book 4 of the Republic that the most important ethical values of the ideal city, and the souls that embody them, are depicted in thought-provoking musical terms: in fact, moderation (sōphrosýnē) and justice (dikaiosýnē) are repeatedly described as a symphonic agreement of sounds (συμφωνία, Resp. 4.430e, 4.431e–432b) or even an actual ‘tuning system’ (ἁρμονία, Resp. 4.443c–444a).|||This paper will focus on Plato’s fascinating depiction of justice as special kind of harmonía that epitomises the best possible organisation of the soul, exploring his nuanced use of the model of lyre tunings in performative, theoretical as well as educational terms. More specifically, by comparing Plato’s use of harmonic imagery with technical discussions of lyre tunings and their key role in educational settings, I will show how Plato exploited distinctive features of traditional Greek lyre harmoníai to give shape to his innovative understanding of the structure of the soul and the harmonious, but not strifeless, relationship between its individual components. In the second part of this paper, I will look at how the model outlined in the Republic sheds light on the musical structure that gives shape to the World Soul in the Timaeus, advancing a new interpretation of its elusive harmonic organisation.|||More generally, this chapter aims at showing how Plato’s harmonic characterisation of the structure of the soul is essentially based on his (and his readers’) acquaintance with basic practical as well as theoretical features of these musical models. Hence, musical theory and practice represented a shared repertoire of concepts that Plato could embrace to express his innovative philosophical notions in terms that his readers could easily relate to on the basis of their own aesthetic, emotional, as well as cognitive experience.|||‘Tuning The Lyre, Tuning The Soul’: Harmonía And The Kósmos Of The Soul Between Plato’s Republic And Timaeus|||Conference paper|||Without Timotheus, much of our melopoiia would not exist; but without Phrynis, there wouldn’t have been Timotheus”: Pherecrates’ twelve strings, the strobilos and the harmonic paranomia of the New Music|||2018 | Journal article | Greek and Roman Musical Studies|||The seductive voice of the aulos in Plato’s Symposium: from the dismissal of the auletris to Alcibiades’ praise of Socrates-auletes|||2018 | Chapter | Music Cultures in Sounds, Words and Images|||in the symposium, Plato presents his readers with many different charac- terisations of the aulos and the performers of this instrument. at the very beginning of the drinking-party (symp. 176e7) the aulos-girl is sent away: given that this instru- ment played a very significant role in the sympotic practices of Classical athens, this exceptional choice calls for an explanation. in the light of the following develop- ments of the dialogue, the dismissal of the αὐλητρίς becomes even more significant. in fact, on the one hand, this character reappears at a key moment of the dialogue, as alcibiades’ dramatic appearance on scene is announced and accompanied precisely by the sound of her “voice” (αὐλητρίδος φωνὴν ἀκούειν, 212c8; cf. 212d6). On the other hand, in his following discourse of praise, alcibiades characterises Socrates as ‘the most wonderful αὐλητής’ and claims that this image not only epitomises the effect of Socrates’ words on the souls of his listeners (cf. 215b-216d) but reveals no less than “the truth” about Socrates (τοῦ ἀληθοῦς ἕνεκα, 215a9). but what do Socrates’ words have in common with the seductive voice of the aulos? in this paper, i will show how these apparently conflicting images can help us understand Plato’s complex and nu- anced attitude towards the alluring voice of the aulos and its psychological effects. more specifically, i will contend that alcibiades’ characterisation of Socrates as the ‘most wonderful aulete’ reveals how the power of Socrates’ seductive words can be truly likened to a ‘good use’ of auletic music. Just as marsyas’ and Olympus’ divine music is capable of revealing who needs to participate in mystic rites, so also Socrates’ aulemata are capable of achieving an effect that goes much deeper than mere rational persuasion and exposes the true ethical needs of his interlocutors. differently from what is often maintained, then, i will argue that Plato is not at all concerned with the capacity of the aulos to provoke deep and powerful emotions; on the contrary, far from rejecting entirely the intense and even ecstatic effects of music, Plato’s aim is to highlight the importance of using these powerful forces correctly. if oriented correctly, both musical and rhetorical aulemata become crucial educational “tools” to give shape to the soul and its inner hierarchy of desires. if oriented in the wrong ethi- cal direction, both the power of persuasive speech and that of music lead to the exact opposite result: psychological (and therefore political) strife.|||Reconstructing Damon: Music, Wisdom Teaching and Politics in Perikles’ Athens , written by Wallace, R.

Phil. and a Dr. Phil. in Classical Archaeology from the University of Vienna. After spending a year in Rome as a Fellow of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, I moved to teach Classical Archaeology at Darmstadt. In 2015, I took up a Lectureship at the University of Birmingham, before joining the Faculty of Classics as Associate Professor of Roman Archaeology and Art.|||Generally speaking, I am a Classical archaeologist with a strong predilection for Roman archaeology. Nonetheless, my interests cover a wider area, including Greek and Roman architecture and architectural decoration, Mediterranean urbanism and urban studies from the early Archaic period to Late Roman times, Roman and Italic sanctuaries, archaeological method and theory, Greek and Roman art, especially portraiture and sculpture, ancient construction techniques and design, material culture and architecture of the Roman provinces, and virtual reconstruction and cultural heritage. I always try to look at Greek and Roman art, architecture and material culture in their Mediterranean context, with particular regard to aspects of cultural transfer, traditions and innovations.|||As a trained Classical archaeologist, my research covers a wide array of topics from Archaic Greece to the Roman Empire, with a special focus on Roman architecture, architectural decoration, urbanism, and sculpture. I have also been working on Late Roman archaeology and the Roman provinces. Furthermore, I have been actively involved in the virtual reconstruction of cultural heritage sites in Austria, Germany and Ireland. My theoretical and methodological approaches are addressed to broader questions of cultural exchange and transformation in the core as well as on the fringes of the Roman world. With the constant aim of approaching ancient material culture in a holistic way, I always try to combine theoretical and practical work, especially fieldwork.|||My latest book ‘Die römischen Bürgerkriege’ (published with Philipp von Zabern in 2018) deals with the complex role of civil war’s internecine violence in the shaping of Roman late republican architecture, art and material culture. In this book, the aspect of annihilation is contrasted with the activities of building, construction and consumption, mainly sponsored by Roman and local elites all over central Italy in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. Against the backdrop of both modern theories of crisis and Late Republican material culture in Italy and the wider Mediterranean (from Spain to Asia Minor), I discuss the concept of ‘crisis’ in detail, stressing the active participation of human agents in shaping their own immediate future.|||From my time as an undergraduate onwards I constantly participated in campaigns of archaeological fieldwork and architectural survey on Classical to Roman sites in Greece, Syria and Austria. In cooperation with Austrian colleagues, I currently conduct a project of architectural survey and excavation in the Archaeological Park of Carnuntum, one of the most important Roman provincial sites on the Danube frontier, where I started as a field archaeologist back in 2001.|||Roman architecture, art and material culture; late Roman republic; Greek and Roman urbanism; the Roman provinces|||Full Publications: dr_maschek_full_publications_list.pdf"

I lived in a cave in the rock-cut city of Petra in Jordan while working on my PhD and The Architecture of Petra. I was Annual Scholar of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. In 1987, I came to Oxford, where I subsequently began work on The Architecture of Alexandria and Egypt 300 BC–AD 700 at St Hugh's College, while Rhys-Davids Junior Research Fellow, followed by a British Academy Post-doctoral Research Fellow. I became a Queen Elizabeth Fellow at the University of Sydney and spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. Since 2003 I have been director of the Khirbet et-Tannur Nabataean Temple Project www.classics.ox.ac.uk/khirbet-et-tannur-nabataean-temple-project.html. In 2012 I established the open-access Manar al-Athar photo-archive http://www.manar-al-athar.ox.ac.uk/ , while working on the Leverhulme Trust Research Project Late Antique Egypt and the Holy Land: Archaeology, History, and Religious Change www.classics.ox.ac.uk/late-antique-egypt-holyland.html (PI Neil McLynn). Since September 2016, I have been Principal Investigator of the project, Monumental Art of the Christian and Early Islamic East: Cultural Identities and Classical Heritage, www.classics.ox.ac.uk/monumental-art-of-the-christian-and-early-islamic-east.html for which I was awarded an ERC Advanced Grant.|||My interest in the architecture, sculpture, and religion of the Nabataeans, the desert tribe of the 3rd century BC to 6th century AD, and their capital Petra began with my work on the architecture of Petra, focusing on the city's larger facades and the free-standing buildings, and on the tombs at Medain Saleh. I demonstrated that the main classical influence on the architecture of Petra in the 1st centuries BC and AD came from Alexandria. That led me to more extensively explore the architecture of Alexandria and Egypt, from Alexander the Great to after the Islamic Conquest. Her re-examination of Nabataean sculpture for the 2003 Petra exhibition in New York resulted in the Khirbet et-Tannur Nabataean Temple Project www.classics.ox.ac.uk/khirbet-et-tannur-nabataean-temple-project.html , when I discovered that the scientific finds from Nelson Glueck's 1937 excavations of the temple were in the Semitic Museum, Harvard University. Studying those finds led me into Nabataean religious practice and iconography. My study of the late antique Ethiopian Garima Gospel illuminations arose as a result of the depictions of architecture in them, some of which have Alexandrian connections, alongside Ethiopian ones.|||My experience working in Syro-Palestine/the Levant and Egypt, since 1981, led to my interest in the continuity, as well as change, which occurred at religious sites in the region in late antiquity (AD 250–750), through the transition of the dominant religion from paganism to Christianity and, in turn, to Islam, resulting in collaboration with Neil McLynn on the Leverhulme Trust Research Project Late Antique Egypt and the Holy Land: Archaeology, History, and Religious Change www.classics.ox.ac.uk/late-antique-egypt-holyland.html .In response to scholars working in the region needing photographs of buildings and art at sites which they could not readily visit, I established the open-access photo-archive www.manar-al-athar.ox.ac.uk in order to present the extensive visual record of sites collected. Since then, many of these monuments have been damaged or are endangered, making these records increasingly important. Many of these buildings are (or were) decorated with monumental scenes, on wall-mosaics, floor mosaics, wall-paintings, and relief sculptures. These artworks became the subject of my current ERC project, Monumental Art of the Christian and Early Islamic East: Cultural Identities and Classical Heritage.|||Greco-Roman and Late Antique East and Egypt; Alexandria; Petra; Religious continuity and change; Architecture, art, sculpture.|||Khirbet et-Tannur Nabataean Temple Project|||Monumental Art of the Christian and Early Islamic East: Cultural Identities and Classical Heritage|||Manar al-Athar Photo Archive|||Late Antique Egypt and the Holy Land|||Full Publications: judith-mckenzie-publications.pdf|||Selected Publications:|||Bayt Farhi and the Sephardic Palaces of Ottoman Damascus in the Late 18th and 19th Centuries|||2017 | Book|||The Garima Gospels Early Illuminated Gospel Books from Ethiopia|||2016 | Book|||It will be an essential resource for those studying late antique art and history, Ethiopia, eastern Christianity, New Testament textual criticism, and illuminated books. 0Like most gospel manuscripts, the Garima Gospels contain ornately ...|||Art|||The world of the Garima Gospels|||2016 | Chapter | The Garima Gospels: Early Illuminated Gospel Books from Ethiopia|||The Context of the Khirbet et-Tannur Zodiac, Jordan|||2014 | Journal article | ARAM Periodical|||Khirbet et-Tannur, Nabataean sculpture, Nabataean religion, Nabataean architecture, Nabataean pottery, Zodiac, Petra, gods and goddesses, offerings, lamps, Jordan|||""Glass Tesserae from Hagios Polyeuktos, Constantinople: their Early Byzantine Affiliations|||2014 | Chapter | Neighbours and Successors of Rome: Traditions of Glass Production and Use in Europe and the Middle East in the Later First Millennium AD|||The Nabataean Temple at Khirbet et-Tannur, Jordan, Volume 1: Architecture and Religion.

And it has also had a profound influence on the reception of Alexander as a political and economic actor in more modern times. Yet that evidence is fragile and its transnational nature means that it is not assured the protection afforded to archaeological heritage that is more easily seen as national. This book explores how new developments in the world of Linked Open Data can help to draw together this huge resource, and exploit it to understand not just Alexander and his Empire, but also our communal heritage.|||Numismatics, Alexander the Great, transnational heritage, coin circulation, semantic web, Linked open data, looting of cultural heritage, metal analysis, classical reception|||The coinage of Arsinoe-Methana|||2018 | Chapter | Obolos 10.

The chronology of the issues is re-examined and on the basis of hoard evidence it is suggested that the issues of Methana must postdate those of Arsinoe, rather than vice versa. As a result it emerges that Methana issued no coinage before the establishment of the Ptolemaic base on the peninsula. Furthermore, all evidence disappears for the existence of an independent city before the creation of the Ptolemaic foundation.|||Coins, Greek|||The Great Transformation.

These topics are central to the composition, authority and legacy of various collections of literature from antiquity –  both biblical and classical – and they have been central to my own research and teaching. My earliest publications were deeply engaged with pseudepigrahy, author function and collection. Since 2010, I have been working on a project which focuses on ancient and contemporary philological practices. This project returns us to a much earlier collaboration between biblicists and rabbinicists, and hellenists and latinists. Conversation among scholars across these corpora is essential for an understanding of practices of philology and reading in antiquity until the present day. My interests are comparative, but I am also focusing on what is shared between these traditions: cultural contexts, reading practices and a shared history of scholarship which begins in antiquity and runs through the history of scholarly practices from late antiquity to the present. I have been particularly focused in recent years on the intimate interaction between biblical and classical studies in the eighteenth and nineteenth century; a period that was formative for both disciplines. So, for example, understanding and problematizing presuppositions of text criticism, interrogation of source criticism and language of recovery of something pure, original or natural. Additionally, we have been putting ancient Jewish texts in conversation with their Greek and Latin contemporaries in order to achieve mutually illuminating discussions around genres, revelation, conceptions of time and of the formation of the soul. These research questions and projects are profoundly enriched by collaboration between Biblical Studies and Classics.|||Philology; Reading Practices; Pseudepigraphy and Pseudonymous Attribution; Fragment; Subject Formation; Canon; Trauma Studies;  Revelation; Perfection; Diaspora and Exile.|||Full Publications: professor_hindy_najman_full_publications.docx"

These experiences have given me special interest in the stories we tell about the past through its material culture.|||My research focuses on analysing the architecture of pre-Roman central Italy in light of modern excavations and theoretical developments. In my 2015 monograph and a series of articles I have explored some of the aesthetic and technical elements of ancient buildings, and will turn next to social experience by examining the evidence for personal connections between people and architecture in Italy between 900 and 400 BC. Under the working title of Building Society: The Anthropology of Architecture in Early Italy, this study will explore the ways in which people interacted with architecture beyond everyday use. Votive deposits associated with the construction and obliteration of buildings show religious concern; miniature architectural models in sanctuaries became ways of communicating with the divine, as did temples; images of buildings were placed on tomb markers in place of texts, and bodies were laid to rest in cinerary urns and chamber tombs that imitated real houses. These signs of intellectual and emotional engagement with the built environment suggest that people in early Italy conceived of their world in architectural terms and used buildings to express their place in it. Like my previous work, this study will explore continuities and contrasts with Roman material culture and thus set these aspects of pre-Roman and Roman archaeology into broader chronological and cultural frameworks.|||Archaic Italy; Etruscan archaeology; Roman art and architecture; museum studies.|||My teaching likewise spans pre-Roman and Roman material.

I intermitted for one year during my doctorate to spend a year in the Institute of Archaeology (UCL) following the MA course in archaeology. My first teaching post was at the University of Leicester, in the School of Archaeology and Ancient History, as a lecturer in ancient history. I have worked on excavations in Germany, Italy and Sicily. As a result I am a text-based classicist by training, with a strong grounding in material culture, and I have spent time in classics, history and archaeology departments. My increasing focus on epigraphy, which bridges textual and material culture has been strongly influenced by this career path. I moved to my current post in Oxford in 2005.|||My doctorate was on the transformation of Sicily into the first Roman province and understanding Hellenistic and Roman Sicily remains a core focus of my research, alongside wider interests in Roman Republican imperialism and political culture, Hellenistic and Roman epigraphy, and a growing involvement in the digital humanities. Many of these interests come together in one of my current major projects, I.Sicily, building a digital corpus of the inscriptions of ancient Sicily (sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk). The project is a leading example of the application of digital techniques to the publication of inscriptions, and is also developing an extensive network of collaborations with museums and scholars across the island, and I am involved in multiple epigraphic projects on the island, including curation of an exhibition at the Museo Civico di Catania, cataloguing the collection of the Syracuse museum, co-editing the Taormina financial inscriptions, publishing the Egadi rostra inscriptions, and co-curating a new lapidarium at the site of Halaesa. I am also now co-directing an archaeological excavation at the Hellenistic/Roman site of ancient Halaesa in northern Sicily (halaesa.web.ox.ac.uk). I have, additionally, been collaborating for a number of years on a French project to produce a new edition (text, translation, commentary) of Cicero's Verrines.|||Beyond Sicily my interests in Roman Republican imperialism have been focused in particular on the phenomenon of 'auxilia externa', the use by Rome of non-Italian soldiers across the Republican empire (which in turn entails a wider engagement in Roman military history); and on the application of data visualisation techniques to the analysis of Roman Republican history (vre.web.ox.ac.uk) in an attempt to challenge the existing narrative framework (part of a broader engagement with the problems of 'Roman imperialism' in general). The co-edited volume 'The Hellenistic West' (Cambridge 2013) exemplifies my wider concerns with Sicilian, Hellenistic and Roman history and challenging established frameworks.|||Ancient Sicily, Roman Republic, Roman provinces, Roman imperialism, Hellenistic history, epigraphy, digital humanities.|||Undergraduate teaching: primarily papers relating to Roman Republican history (period papers 241-146 BC, 146-46 BC, 46 BC - AD 54; Cicero and Catiline) and I regularly teach the final year class on Cicero: Politics and Thought.|||Masters teaching: Roman Republican and hellenistic history, and epigraphy (including digital methods).|||PhD supervision: I have supervised and am currently supervising doctoral students in Roman Republican history (including Polybius, republican provinces, and the Roman army) and ancient Sicily (including Agathokles and religious identity in western Sicily) and would welcome students in these areas and others, including epigraphy and in the application of digital humanities to classical studies.|||Full Publications: prag_publications.pdf|||Selected Publications:|||Selected Publications|||I.Sicily: an epidoc corpus for ancient Sicily|||Chapter | Digital and Traditional Epigraphy in Context.

In preparing my first book - a commentary on Book 2 of Ovid's Fasti - I became interested in the ways in which texts can engage with not only with other texts but also with the non-textual - for example, religious ritual, art or astronomy. My current research focuses on literature's engagement with sub-literary genres such as declamation, and also on the use of acrostics and telestics in classical poetry.|||Latin literature; Ovid; Propertius; Vergil; Catullus; astronomy; mythography; paratext; acrostics; telestics|||Full Publications: Dr Matthew Robinson publications|||Selected Publications:|||Arms and A Mouse. Approaching acrostics in Ovid and Vergil|||Journal article | Materiali e Discussioni per l'Analisi dei Testi Classici|||In this article I begin by comparing and contrasting our reading practice regarding acrostics with our practice regarding allusions and intertexts, looking in particular at the problematic notion of authorial intention; I suggest an approach that assumes that ancient learned readers were on the look-out for acrostics, just as they were for allusions, and that they would test them for significance (as we imagine they did for allusions). I then apply this approach to the beginning and end of the Aeneid, and the beginning of the Metamorphoses, exploring how our reading of these well-studied passages changes if we pay attention to the acrostics and telestics that this process unearths. I note among other things how the presence of ILUS, of ARMA and a man, and of a Horatian MUS and a Vergilian ERATO can enrich our reading of the text. I close with an old and particularly controversial acrostic in Eclogue 4 (CACATA) that presents a potential challenge to my approach.|||Acrostics, Ovid, Virgil|||Propertius 1.3: Sleep, Surprise and Catullus 64|||Journal article | Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies|||Ovid and the Catasterismi of Eratosthenes|||2013 | Journal article | American Journal of Philology|||Propertius 1.3: Sleep, Surprise and Catullus 64|||2013 | Journal article | Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies|||A Commentary on Ovid’s Fasti, Book 2|||2010 | Book|||Ardua et Astra:  On the Calculation of the Dates of the Rising and Setting of Stars|||2009 | Journal article | Classical Philology|||More"

I am most interested in the regions of Attica, Macedonia and Boeotia, and I also work on Greek material from the Iberian Peninsula.|||As a JRF I am working on a research project about the ‘consumption’ of Athenian pottery in the southeastern region of the Iberian Peninsula in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Very roughly, I want to know why, how, and when the Iberians used Athenian pots, how they integrated them within their own exiting material and visual culture, and which consequences the cultural encounter between them and the Greeks had in the production of the Athenian pottery workshops. Some of the phenomena that I am investigating are pottery repairs, intentional alteration of Athenian pottery in Peninsular contexts (trimmed-down vases, fragmentary pottery in necropolis and settlement contexts), targeted production of pottery, Iberian assimilation of Athenian images...|||My PhD was an exploration of the meaning of the snake in the ancient Greek world through a number of case studies using a wide range of textual and material evidence. My postdoctoral research focused on a class of vases called 'Exaleiptra/Plemochoai' to explore the relationship between 'representation' and 'reality' in archaic and classical Greece; it was succesful in showing some specificities of Greek visual language regarding the negotiation of gender identitites and contributed to the fundamental question of how to understand Greek imagery.

Largely as a result of this, it remains one of antiquity’s most underrated documents; frequently side-lined as a curiosity, or dismissed as a forgery. The position I take for this paper is to argue that with the debate on the text’s authenticity seemingly deadlocked on a philological level, it is necessary to advance arguments addressing the other major objection to the possibility of its author being Quintus Cicero, that is to say, the purpose of this baffling document. I propose that an approach to this text which takes its philosophical context into account both supports Quintus Cicero’s claim to authorship and provides evidence for certain aspects of his brother’s historic election to the consulship. I situate the text within the contemporary debate which attempted to categorize all activities as either a teachable technē or an innate dunamis. By showing that this election should be understood as the former, Quintus could promote the idea that his brother’s rise was to be attributed to successful electioneering, not backdoor Pompeian intrigue.|||Marcus Tullius Cicero, Commentariolum Petitionis, Quintus Cicero, Latin Philosophy, Roman Politics, Roman History, Latin Literature, Roman Republic|||More"

This chapter explains the following paradox: much of what was new and different in the visual and monumental culture of the Greek east was due in some way to Rome; at the same time, however, little of it was intended or probably experienced by contemporaries as anything other than, in political-cultural terms, neutral, local, or Hellenic. Throughout the period Greek, Roman, and local elements are present in different combinations, contexts, and media, depending on the subjects and purposes of the monuments concerned. To get at some of these complexities, the chapter considers four major zones where different subjects and functions intersect in distinct building and monument categories: the realm of the emperor; the realm of the gods; the realm of the citizen; and the realm of the dead. These zones were of course closely connected in the fabric of the city, but they are convenient horizontal sections through the material.|||Eikōn chalkē: Hellenistic statue honours in bronze|||2015 | Chapter | Power and Pathos Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World|||As the first comprehensive volume on large-scale Hellenistic bronze statuary, this book includes groundbreaking archaeological, art-historical, and scientific essays offering new approaches to understanding ancient production and correctly ...|||Art|||Citizens and kings in the Tomba Bella at Hierapolis.

Visits to the Underworld from Antiquity to Byzantium|||The aim of the chapter is to offer a regional perspective on the issue of Underworld journeys in Antiquity by tracing Thessalian attitudes to Hades from the Classical to the Hellenistic period. What do we know of the beliefs regarding the Underworld in Thessaly, a land where one of the most famous and successful katabaseis occurred? Our starting point will be the most famous Thessalian ‘round trip’ to Hades, that of Alkestis, portrayed through Athenian eyes in Euripides’ tragedy and Plato. This will allow us to discuss eschatological beliefs reflected in fifth-century bce Athenian literary works and address some of the stereotypes about Thessaly, as both are linked to the questions under discussion. We will then turn to Thessaly itself and exam- ine a variety of relevant evidence pertaining to cults of deities linked with passages and human destiny, the gold lamellae from Pherai and Pharsalos, funerary epigrams from the region echoing themes attested in the lamellae or revealing a concern with or a belief in the possibility of a blessed afterlife or for a ‘round trip to the Underworld’ and last but not least, the evidence from contemporary Thessalian necropoleis. As will be seen, the Thessalian evidence, although of a complex and often disparate nature, is suggestive of a heightened interest in the safe journey to the Underworld or a blessed afterlife.|||Thessaly, Greek Religion, funerary customs|||Demetrias: The Archaeology of a Cosmopolitan Macedonian Harbour|||2018 | Chapter | Βορειοελλαδικά.

Most recently, I was a Teaching Fellow at the University of Birmingham for 2017/18 (teaching a wide range of Greek history, language, and literature to undergraduate and Master’s students), and before that (2013-17) held the Leventis Research Fellowship in Ancient Greek at Merton College, teaching most of the college’s Greek literature and language. I did my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Oxford before that, and served as Stipendiary Lecturer at Magdalen College in 2012/13.|||My main research interests are in classical oratory and rhetoric, especially in Athenian political oratory of the fourth century BC. My doctoral thesis (2014), a revised version of which is to appear in OUP’s Oxford Classical Monographs series, examined how two significant mid-fourth-century Athenian politicians – Demosthenes and Aeschines – used the city’s past (and the wider Greek past) in the task of persuading mass citizen audiences, especially in public trials, in the political Assembly, and on ceremonial occasions. Both orators use examples of past leaders and events not only to reflect on a troubled contemporary political landscape – Demosthenes’ few years as one of Athens’s leading policy-makers were precisely the years when Athens faced its showdown with Philip II of Macedon – but also as a way of building their own credibility and authority as statesmen who should be listened to, and as a way of competing with rivals (sometimes each other). To show how these dynamics worked in practice, the book offers a sequence of in-depth readings of the rhetorical strategies at work in individual speeches and groups of speeches. I have published several articles on a variety of oratorical topics spinning out from work on the thesis and book (see Publications tab).|||Virtually any development in the study of fifth- and fourth-century Greece tends to interest me, though, and I am embarking on a monograph-scale project which sets Athenian oratory in its context as a performance genre: by examining its many levels of interaction with fifth- and fourth-century comedy. Oratory is a genre notably porous to others, and I also retain research interests in Greek and Roman historiography and political thought, and in Greek drama in general – as well as in Roman oratory and rhetorical prose.v|||Greek and Roman oratory and rhetoric; Athenian democracy; comedy; historiography|||At the Faculty/University level, I am co-running the Historiography provision at undergraduate and Master’s level with Prof Rhiannon Ash, and lecturing on Xenophon for Greek Language in Mods.

But it is in Book 4 of the Republic that the most important ethical values of the ideal city, and the souls that embody them, are depicted in thought-provoking musical terms: in fact, moderation (sōphrosýnē) and justice (dikaiosýnē) are repeatedly described as a symphonic agreement of sounds (συμφωνία, Resp. 4.430e, 4.431e–432b) or even an actual ‘tuning system’ (ἁρμονία, Resp. 4.443c–444a).|||This paper will focus on Plato’s fascinating depiction of justice as special kind of harmonía that epitomises the best possible organisation of the soul, exploring his nuanced use of the model of lyre tunings in performative, theoretical as well as educational terms. More specifically, by comparing Plato’s use of harmonic imagery with technical discussions of lyre tunings and their key role in educational settings, I will show how Plato exploited distinctive features of traditional Greek lyre harmoníai to give shape to his innovative understanding of the structure of the soul and the harmonious, but not strifeless, relationship between its individual components. In the second part of this paper, I will look at how the model outlined in the Republic sheds light on the musical structure that gives shape to the World Soul in the Timaeus, advancing a new interpretation of its elusive harmonic organisation.|||More generally, this chapter aims at showing how Plato’s harmonic characterisation of the structure of the soul is essentially based on his (and his readers’) acquaintance with basic practical as well as theoretical features of these musical models. Hence, musical theory and practice represented a shared repertoire of concepts that Plato could embrace to express his innovative philosophical notions in terms that his readers could easily relate to on the basis of their own aesthetic, emotional, as well as cognitive experience.|||‘Tuning The Lyre, Tuning The Soul’: Harmonía And The Kósmos Of The Soul Between Plato’s Republic And Timaeus|||Conference paper|||Without Timotheus, much of our melopoiia would not exist; but without Phrynis, there wouldn’t have been Timotheus”: Pherecrates’ twelve strings, the strobilos and the harmonic paranomia of the New Music|||2018 | Journal article | Greek and Roman Musical Studies|||The seductive voice of the aulos in Plato’s Symposium: from the dismissal of the auletris to Alcibiades’ praise of Socrates-auletes|||2018 | Chapter | Music Cultures in Sounds, Words and Images|||in the symposium, Plato presents his readers with many different charac- terisations of the aulos and the performers of this instrument. at the very beginning of the drinking-party (symp. 176e7) the aulos-girl is sent away: given that this instru- ment played a very significant role in the sympotic practices of Classical athens, this exceptional choice calls for an explanation. in the light of the following develop- ments of the dialogue, the dismissal of the αὐλητρίς becomes even more significant. in fact, on the one hand, this character reappears at a key moment of the dialogue, as alcibiades’ dramatic appearance on scene is announced and accompanied precisely by the sound of her “voice” (αὐλητρίδος φωνὴν ἀκούειν, 212c8; cf. 212d6). On the other hand, in his following discourse of praise, alcibiades characterises Socrates as ‘the most wonderful αὐλητής’ and claims that this image not only epitomises the effect of Socrates’ words on the souls of his listeners (cf. 215b-216d) but reveals no less than “the truth” about Socrates (τοῦ ἀληθοῦς ἕνεκα, 215a9). but what do Socrates’ words have in common with the seductive voice of the aulos? in this paper, i will show how these apparently conflicting images can help us understand Plato’s complex and nu- anced attitude towards the alluring voice of the aulos and its psychological effects. more specifically, i will contend that alcibiades’ characterisation of Socrates as the ‘most wonderful aulete’ reveals how the power of Socrates’ seductive words can be truly likened to a ‘good use’ of auletic music. Just as marsyas’ and Olympus’ divine music is capable of revealing who needs to participate in mystic rites, so also Socrates’ aulemata are capable of achieving an effect that goes much deeper than mere rational persuasion and exposes the true ethical needs of his interlocutors. differently from what is often maintained, then, i will argue that Plato is not at all concerned with the capacity of the aulos to provoke deep and powerful emotions; on the contrary, far from rejecting entirely the intense and even ecstatic effects of music, Plato’s aim is to highlight the importance of using these powerful forces correctly. if oriented correctly, both musical and rhetorical aulemata become crucial educational “tools” to give shape to the soul and its inner hierarchy of desires. if oriented in the wrong ethi- cal direction, both the power of persuasive speech and that of music lead to the exact opposite result: psychological (and therefore political) strife.|||Reconstructing Damon: Music, Wisdom Teaching and Politics in Perikles’ Athens , written by Wallace, R.

My DPhil in History was on “The African policy of Justinian I”.  Since completing my DPhil in 2015, I have been a Research Associate on the Leverhulme Trust-funded project Late Antique Egypt and the Holy Land: Archaeology, History and Religious Change, www.classics.ox.ac.uk/late-antique-egypt-holyland.html, (PI: Neil McLynn), and am currently a Research Associate for Manar al-Athar, www.manar-al-athar.ox.ac.uk (Director: Judith McKenzie)|||My primary research interest is in the political history of the later Roman Empire, with a particular focus on foreign relations in the 6th century AD. My DPhil thesis, which I am currently revising for publication, focused on North Africa under the emperor Justinian I (AD 527–565), exploring how a centralised state, such as the Later Roman Empire, managed its relations with tribal groups on its frontier, but I am also interested in the broader questions of empire-wide “grand strategy” and client-state management in other geographical contexts, as well as in the transition from Roman to Islamic rule in North Africa.  I also work on the corpus of the 6th-century Greek writer Procopius, and on the use of imperial legislation of the period as a historical source.|||Late antique history and historiography, Foreign Relations, North Africa, Procopius.|||Full Publications: dr_miranda_williams_full_list_of_publications.docx|||Selected Publication:|||""The establishment of Roman authority in Africa: Romans and Berbers in Procopius' Vandalic War,"" in S.
